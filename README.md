# bamazon

_Welcome to the *bamazon* storefront!_  This app allows users to see a table the displays: 
* the items in our inventory 
* the item names * the item department 
* item price 
* item stock quantities  

User is then prompted to select an item_id and a quantity that they wish to purchase.  Once the app checks its inventory to make sure the store sells the item and the quantities requested are availabe, customer can make a purchase.  After the purchase goes through, customer is provided with the total cost for their purchase along with an updated table of the new quantities in stock should they choose to purchase something else.  

Refer to the [video]("./bamazon_customer.mov") to see a live demonstration of the app in motion!
